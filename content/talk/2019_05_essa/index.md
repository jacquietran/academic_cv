# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "How can analytics be applied to better understand our clients, our patients, our  athletes, our coaches? How can data be used to support better decision-making by exercise and sport professionals? What are some key data skills and competencies that exercise and sport professionals can develop to serve current and emerging industry needs? This presentation will provide a window into the how analytics is used in exercise and sport settings. I will showcase real-world examples that are relevant to exercise and sport contexts, share my experiences with applying data analytics in elite sport, and highlight opportunities for growth in exercise and sport analytics. My aim is to encourage exercise and sport professionals to think creatively about the place and purpose of data in their daily work, and actively integrate analytical thinking and analytical methods in their workplaces."
